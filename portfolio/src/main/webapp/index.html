      <p>Most of the projects I did are school projects</p>
      <p>The first project I did is Calculate Maximum Drawdown when I interned at a securities company</p>
      <p>First time touching Computer Science and coding and making a project, arousing my interest in studying Computer Science in college</p>
      <p>And I would say Euchre is the most diffcult project I ever did</p>
